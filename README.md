# Cifar10_Classification
Classification Cifar Dataset using different Machine Learning Classification Model

In this project, the classificaiton of cifar-10 dataset is performed. This project is intended to use different machine leanring algorithm for classifying cifar dataset. Cifar 10 dataset consist of huge number of images along with their lables. These images are for 10 different classes which includes automobile, airplane, cat, birds, deer, dog, ship, frog, horse and truck. In this notebook, the object recoginision related problem is solved and the models are trained based on cifar 10 dataset. This is an excellent study and it can be generalized to other dataset as well where the model can be trained on some images and then the new images will be classified base on the fitted model. In real world it has alot of application to detect several object using model fitting.
