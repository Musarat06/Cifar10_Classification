# Cifar10_Classification
Classification Cifar Dataset using different Machine Learning Classification Models

In this project, the classification of the cifar-10 dataset is performed. This project is intended to use different machine learning algorithms for classifying cifar datasets. Cifar 10 dataset consists of a huge number of images along with their labels. These images are for 10 different classes which includes automobile, airplane, cat, birds, deer, dog, ship, frog, horse, and truck. In this notebook, the object recoginision related problem is solved and the models are trained based on cifar 10 dataset. This is an excellent study and it can be generalized to another dataset as well where the model can be trained on some images and then the new images will be classified based on the fitted model. In the real world, it has a lot of applications to detect several objects using model fitting.
